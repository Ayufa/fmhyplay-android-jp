## 2.18.4

Everything new since 2.17.1 (2.18.0 to 2.18.4 together).

### ✨ New
- **Series and anime in the player**: Episodes list (seasons, pictures, names), Previous and Next, and the next episode starts by itself.
- **Skip intro, recap and credits**, with a Next episode button at the credits (OK on the remote presses it). Settings, Skip intros skips them without asking.
- **Sub / Dub button** for anime: one press switches, each site remembers your pick.
- **Episodes open directly** on 34 TV sites and 22 anime sites. Elsewhere the app presses the episode on the site for you, also behind a player's Episodes menu (Cinefork, Aether, Basement).
- **A title's own page** opens on about 70 sites; the others are searched and the match opened. Anime opens on anime sites only, wherever you open it from.
- **Title page**: the sites in one row with the episodes right below, plus cast, director, seasons and episodes, still running or ended, country and awards.
- **Subtitles in any language** (Arabic and others that never showed), converted so every script shows right, and lined up with the speech by themselves when a file is off.
- **Picture in picture** on phones, and **hold for 2x**: right side forward, left side back.
- **Site pop-ups** like "Join our Discord" and "What's new" close by themselves; movies opened from the catalog start playing by themselves.

### 🔧 Changed
- **New player look**: one row of icons (Previous, Next, Quality, Audio, Sub / Dub, Episodes, Servers, Subtitles, More, Cast, Full screen) and what is picked under the title. Speed, boosts, zoom and From the start are in More. On a TV the button the remote is on shows its name.
- **FMHYPlayer**: the player has a name; its button sits on the site's own player.
- **Anime tab**: its big grid is Popular anime (real anime only) and keeps loading more.
- **WARP connects on more networks**, says why when it can't, and stops at once when Cloudflare limits sign-ups (HTTP 429). **Settings, WARP DNS** takes your provider's DNS.
- **Movies, TV, Anime and the update alert** no longer wait for WARP; new site addresses arrive within the hour.
- **Phone top bar**: the logo alone, so Search gets the room.

### 🐞 Fixed
- **"Next episode" showed near the start of an episode** (Death Note and others) instead of Skip intro: opening titles listed as credits in the skip data are now ignored.
- **Next episode no longer starts by itself during the credits**: the 10 second countdown is gone, only your press moves on before the video ends.
- **Next from a resumed anime** opens the episode's own page and returns to the player, instead of hunting for the episode on the site.
- **Resuming an anime on AnimeX** (and other players that load their playlist under an address without ".m3u8") stayed on the site: the playlist is noticed again, and a remembered Sub / Dub that was already playing no longer holds the video back.
- **The site's own Settings / quality menu** no longer opens by itself while FMHYPlay looks for servers, when the page already lists them.
- **Resuming an anime** could leave you on the site with "No video found" when the site remembered Dub (or Sub) and the episode didn't have it.
- **Anime opened from the general catalog** (Death Note and others) listed movie and TV sites.
- **App closed on start on Android 8 and 9** (many TV boxes, Fire OS 7, older Sony TVs).
- **StreamCorner** showed a blank page and its live streams never reached the player.
- **NekoWatch and other sites behind one proxy address**: a new episode or the Dub version now reaches the player.
- **Servers on Cinejoy** listed the player's skip buttons.
- **IPTV on a TV**: a channel tile kept its ring after the remote moved to the chips.
- **Subtitle settings in landscape**: Reset and Done stay on screen.

## 2.18.3

Everything new since 2.17.1 (2.18.0 to 2.18.3 together).

- **Anime tab**: its big grid is now Popular anime (real anime only), and keeps loading more.

### 🐞 Fixed
- **Anime opened from the general catalog** (Death Note and others) listed movie and TV sites: animated titles the anime databases know now get the anime sites.

## 2.17.1

### 🐞 Fixed
- **Dialog boost** made everything quieter: it now lowers rumble and bass and lifts the level, so voices come out louder. Turning a boost off brings the sound fully back at once.

## 2.17.0

### ✨ New
- **DLNA / UPnP casting**: smart TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, Kodi and others show up in the Cast list ("Name - DLNA"), through the phone like Chromecast.
- **Fire TV**: install with Downloader code 9828006; the link `releases/latest/download/FMHYPlay-TV.apk` always gets the newest version.
- **Stalker portals**: add your IPTV provider's portal address and MAC address (MAG login) next to Xtream; channels get their own row.
- **PunchPlay**: Settings, PunchPlay connects with a code at punchplay.tv/link; movies and episodes you watch are tracked there, like Simkl.
- **IPTV filters and pins**: channel lists have Category and Language chips (movies, TV, kids and news first; Hindi, English, Tamil for India). The pin button keeps a list with its chips (India · News · Hindi) as its own row on the IPTV tab.

### 🔧 Changed
- **Audio language**: the language you pick on the player's Audio button is where every next video starts, when it has it (then your device's language), instead of the stream's default, often English. The list shows language names, not "stream_4".

## 2.16.1

### 🐞 Fixed
- **Dialog boost** is off by default again: it caused sound problems on some devices. Turn it on in Settings or with its button in the player.
- **TV tabs** show a ring when the remote is on them.

## 2.16.0

### ✨ New
- **Cast to TV**: the Cast button in the player sends the video to a TV on your Wi-Fi, from the same spot. The phone becomes the remote (play/pause, seek, volume keys).
- **FMHYPlay on the TV** (recommended): plays every stream the phone can, even when the app is closed. On the TV: Settings → Cast to this TV → allow once.
- **Chromecast**: Google TV and Cast TVs work without FMHYPlay on the TV. The phone relays the stream, so keep it on the same Wi-Fi.
- **Your language**: Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Arabic and German, picked from the device.

### 🔧 Changed
- **Dialog boost** is on by default.
- **Pop-ups**: a link a site opens in a new window now opens in the same tab (Back returns). Ad pop-ups are dropped, and the link you tapped opens anyway (CricHD's Watch works in one tap).
- **Continue watching** shows the catalog poster for titles opened from Movies, TV or Anime, also on sites without their own.

### 🐞 Fixed
- Volume boost and Dialog boost had no effect on many phones and TVs.

## 1.2.0

- アプリ内アップデートの参照先をこのリポジトリのリリースに変更（上流版の更新が混ざらないようにするため）
